beeStop \- stop a robot

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <bee.h>

.BI "bool beeStop(void);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "beeStop()"
stops a BeeSoft Light robot when it is moving. 

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, the function will return TRUE.  On error, FALSE is 
returned.

.SH NOTES
The function hides the details of the message pass among 
BeeSoft Light servers. However, you should at least run 
.B "tcxServer" 
and
.B "colliServer" 
first. Your shell should set environment variable 
.B "TCXHOST" 
to the host name which runs 
.BR "tcxServer". 
You should also invoke function 
.B "beeInitialize()" 
before 
.B "beeStop()" 
function in your program. Otherwise, 
the movement can not be executed and the function will return FALSE.
