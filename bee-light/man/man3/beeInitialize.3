.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "beeInitialize()"
initialize a BeeSoft Light user process. The 
.I "moduleName" 
argument specifies the name of your user process module. 
It will initialize tcx communication, register call back functions,
connect to TCX server and colliServer, and so forth. If you do not 
provide the argument, the default modulename is "USER". You should 
give names if you have more than one user processes running.

.B "TCXHOST" 
to the host name which runs 
.BR "tcxServer".
