</FONT><P>BeeSoft is the software that lets you navigate your robot. Each robot contains one or more onboard computers that control its resources, such as its mobile base, sonar, lasers, camera, pan/tilt head, and enable robot to move forward along a specific heading, detecting a nearby obstacle, and capture images from its camera.</P>
<P>The overall software architecture consists of several modules (processes) running in parallel on on-board laptops and off-board workstations. Those server modules manage robot resources well, empowering you to control those resources as if they were local to your own program. The software modules communicate using <I>TCX</I>, a centralized communication protocol for point-to point socket communication. Your own user application program communicates with the server modules, and thus directs the robot¡¦s activities, via BeeSoft API (Application Programming Interface) function calls. For example, when you want to tell the robot to move forward a certain distance, you need only call the appropriate function in the client API library. The client API library function then determines which server modules should work together and then instructs base server to initiate forward motion.</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>tcxServer</B> coordinates communications among all other modules running on all computers in the robot system. TCX is a decentralized communication protocol for point-to-point socket communication. Processes invoke TCX API to communicate with each other.</LI>
<B><LI>pioneer/baseServer</B> issues commands to the robot's wheeled base. It can move forwards and backwards, as well as rotational motion ¡V clockwise and counterclockwise ¡V around the robot¡¦s center axis. You could run <I>pioneer</I> for little robots Marion and Robin, or <I>baseServer</I> for Amelia and Xavier. </LI>
<B><LI>laserServer</B> administrates the equipped laser device. </LI>
<B><LI>cameraServer </B>administrates the equipped camera device.</LI>
<B><LI>colliServer</B> sends commands to <I>pioneer/baseServer</I> in guarded motion mode, that is, incorporating built-in collision avoidance. You give the module a target point, either a relative target point or an absolute target point. The robot will try its best to avoid obstacles it can perceive. It uses sonar and laser devices to know the robot¡¦s environment. It knows how far the obstacles are by emitting sonar and laser and then collecting the reflection. Other modules could also subscribe to those sensor readings. Notice that <I>pioneer/baseServer</I> do not include automatic obstacle avoidance. They just order the robot to move.</LI>
<B><LI>Planner</B> is the robot motion management and exploration software. It helps the robot plan optimal motion and optimal paths. When Planner receives a target, it will compute the best path and then give several intermediate goal points to the colliServer. Planner is not necessary to run on an on-board laptop. While colliServer provides local collision avoidance, Planner provides global path finding. To do so, it needs a map of the robot¡¦s environment.  We could use a program called Mapper to establish maps, but it is beyond the scope of this document.</LI>
<B><LI>LOCALIZE </B>is a module which continuously estimates the robot¡¦s position in x-y-<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#113;</FONT>
 space, where x and y are the coordinates of the robot in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system and <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#113;</FONT>
 is its orientation. colliServer has a base coordinate system which is different from map coordinate system. Moreover, robot may drift so that it will deviate from its target direction. LOCALIZE monitors the robot and keeps<B> </B>computing corrected<B> </B>coordinate parameters. It uses sensor readings and action commands to keep estimating positions. Then task planning modules, such as user modules, can use those parameters to transform map coordinates to robot¡¦s base coordinates, which are accepted by colliServer.  </LI>
<B><LI>SET_ROBOT </B>gives the robot an initial point in map coordinate system. Otherwise, LOCALIZE does not know where to locate the robot initially.</LI></UL>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>¡@</P>
</FONT><P>TCX grants the BeeSoft system scalability of adding more modules. BeeSoft package includes some other modules to administrate onboard devices, such as pantiltServer, armServer, speechServer. But not all of the robots have those devices. A programmer can write a USER module to ask the robot to perform a task. This module also uses TCX mechanism to communicate with other modules. In this architecture, there could be many user modules running concurrently. Modules request for services by passing messages to the server modules and receive the reply messages. Each BeeSoft module defines a number of messages. Other modules could ask this module for services by sending messages through TCX API. BeeSoft API library encapsulates the details of the underlying communication infrastructure. You could write programs easily even if you do not know TCX.</P>

<P>The following steps guide you to run your robot. In Robot Learning Laboratory, I assume that you are using the little robots, Marion or Robin. </P>
<OL>

<LI>Switch on main power, radio power, laser power, and motor power. Please contact members in the lab. to learn the location of those switches.</LI>
<LI>Run the following programs in the robot¡¦s onboard laptops. Each program needs a shell to run. You could use ¡§ssh marion¡¨ or ¡§ssh robin¡¨ to login to the computers. Then remember to type ¡§setenv TCXHOST marion¡¨ or ¡§setenv TCXHOST robin¡¨ so that the server modules can locate the tcxServer. </LI></OL>
<DIR>

<P>Change to the beeSoft ¡§bin¡¨ directory first. Then run:</P>

<LI>colliServer +laserServer ¡Vpioneer<BR>
</LI></UL>

<P>After those server modules run, you could ask the robot to move locally without a map. Since you have not implemented any user module program yet, you could use colliServer commands to order the robot.</P>
<P>In the colliServer shell, type &quot;CTR 100 0&quot;. You ask the robot to move one meter (100 centimeters ahead).</P>
<P>CTR stands for &quot;control translation and rotation&quot;. The first argument is the distance, in centimeters, you want the robot to move along its current heading: the heading towards which it is already pointed. A positive value in this argument sends the robot forward. The second argument is the distance, again in centimeters, that you want the robot to move perpendicular to its heading.</P>
<P>Note that colliServer will attempt to move the robot to the point one meter directly ahead of itself, that is, one meter in the direction the robot is facing when you issue the CRT command. If that spot is blocked (occupied by an obstacle), the robot will continue maneuvering to try to reach that point.</P>
<P>To ask your robot to go back, type &quot;CTR ¡V100 0&quot;. </P>
<P>Type &quot;?&quot; in colliServer shell to learn more commands.</P>
<P>BeeSoft robot has a capability of optimal path finding. To do so, you need a map of the environment. You could use Mapper to establish the map, but it is beyond the scope of this document.</P>
<P>To enable the optimal path finding functionality, run the following server modules as well. But they are not required to run in the robot¡¦s onboard laptop. You could run them in a remote workstation. You need an X-window workstation to display windows those processes create. Change to the &quot;localize&quot; directory first,</P>

<P>Every program starts with beeInitialize() function. This function initializes connection with TCX server and registers message handlers for your user module application. Your BeeSoft program must also start with this function.</P>
<P>The prototypes of those functions are defined in <I>bee.h</I>. Include the file in the beginning of your C program.</P>
