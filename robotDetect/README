robotDetect HowTo
  (hkr)
------------------------------------

Since QuickCam has a LPT-interface, BOTH cameraServer and 
robotDetect MUST be owned by root. After compiling dont
forget to:

su
chown root cameraServer robotDetect
chmod 4711 cameraServer robotDetect


If you want to see grabbed camera pictures, run X -bpp 8 (xstdcmap
-best as well). Else use option -nodisplay for BOTH cameraServer and
robotDetect.

valid robotNames: {marion, robin} Both cameraServer and robotDetect
MUST run be run on the robot and not remotely, because they
communicate via shm.

Because of file system export restrictions, BOTH cameraServer
and robotDetect MUST be run from root shells. This might seems
odd at first, but just do it!

cd /home12/hannes/bee/bin
tcxServer
pioneer -robot [name] (setenv TCXHOST [name]!!!!)
cameraServer -robot [name] (su, setenv DISPLAY yourhost:0.0)
laserServer -pioneer -robot [name]
